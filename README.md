project at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) Become a Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written on articles or blogs found on other websites. When a user submits a URL of an article, the web page then dispalys sentiment analysis returned from [meaningcloud API](https://www.meaningcloud.com/products/sentiment-analysis), based on the contents of the article.
